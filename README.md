# HABITOS - Human Actions in Buildings: Interactions between Technical Building Systems and Occupants Simulator

The **HABITOS** (Human Actions in Buildings: Interactions between Technical building systems and Occupants Simulator) repository is developed by the [**Energy and Materials in Infrastructure and Buildings (EMIB)**](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/emib/) research group at the **University of Antwerp**.

HABITOS provides a framework to simulate occupant behavior in buildings and its interactions with technical building systems. This allows researchers and practitioners to study energy demand, occupant comfort, and the impact of building control strategies.
