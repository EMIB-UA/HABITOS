## RELICS – Residential Lighting Interaction and Control Simulation

**RELICS** (Residential Lighting Interaction and Control Simulation) is a submodel of the [HABITOS](../README.md) framework, developed by the [Energy and Materials in Infrastructure and Buildings (EMIB)](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/emib/) research group at the University of Antwerp.  

RELICS simulates occupant interactions with residential lighting systems, with specific attention to behavioural variability.
For more detailed information on the functioning of the model and its underlying assumptions, see [Van Thillo et al., 2025](doi aanvullen).
It is implemented in **Python** and is specifically designed to operate **in conjunction with EnergyPlus**, allowing detailed building energy simulations that integrate occupant behavior with building system performance. However, the code is modular and can be adapted to work with other simulation tools if desired.
